## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### Neural Network Architecture (Optimized by Optuna)

The final architecture was determined by a 50-trial Optuna study to maximize AUC.

```python
class EnhancedDiabetesModel:
    - Input Layer: 16 features (from enhanced Pima dataset)
    - Hidden Layers: [242, 110] neurons (determined by Optuna)
    - Activation: ReLU with Batch Normalization
    - Regularization: 44.7% Dropout (determined by Optuna)
    - Output: Sigmoid activation for binary classification
    - Optimizer: AdamW with optimized learning rate (5.6e-4) and weight decay
    - Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss
```

### Feature Engineering & Data Pipeline

| Original Datasets                          | Engineered Features (Pima)                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pima Indians Dataset (768 samples)         | BMI_Age, Glucose_BMI, Insulin_Glucose, BMI_squared, Age_squared, Glucose_Age_ratio |
| BRFSS Dataset (Sampled to 100,000 records) | **+8 engineered = 16 total features for Pima**                                     |

### Data Preprocessing

- **Combined Data Strategy**: While both datasets were loaded, the final model was trained on the richly engineered Pima dataset for optimal performance in the target domain.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Median imputation for physiologically impossible zeros in the Pima dataset.
- **Feature Scaling**: `StandardScaler` normalization applied across all features.
- **Data Splits**: 80% train, 20% test, with K-Fold cross-validation performed during tuning.

## � Innovation Highlights

### 1. Automated Hyperparameter Optimization

- **Optuna & K-Fold CV**: Rigorously searched for the best hyperparameters by training and validating across 5 different folds of the data for each trial. This ensures the chosen parameters are robust and not overfitted to a single data split.
- **Efficiency**: Completed 50 trials of 5-fold CV in minutes, a process that would take hours to do manually.

### 2. Model Interpretability with SHAP

- **Trust and Transparency**: Moved beyond "black box" predictions by implementing SHAP in `interpretability.py`.
- **Visual Explanations**: Generated summary plots that clearly show which features are driving the model's predictions, for both the overall model and individual patients.

### 3. Advanced Training Pipeline

- **Unified Script**: `train.py` now handles everything from data loading and preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning, final model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Modular Code**: The NN model is defined in `models.py`, promoting clean architecture and reuse.

## 🎯 Production Deployment Features

### Simplified Prediction System

The `predict_simple.py` script provides a clear and straightforward example of how to load the trained model and make predictions.

```python
# Example usage from predict_simple.py
# (Conceptual - script is currently non-interactive)
predictor = DiabetesPredictor('models/enhanced_diabetes_nn.pth', 'models/combined_scaler.pkl')

# New patient data
new_data = pd.DataFrame(...)

# Get prediction
result = predictor.predict(new_data)

# Output: {'prediction': 1, 'probability': 0.92}
```

### System Capabilities

✅ **Optimized Model Loading**: Loads the best-performing `.pth` model.
